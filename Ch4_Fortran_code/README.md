This folder contains the Fortran file which has the code for establishing bonds in between the atoms of the water constellations.
It also contains the batch file which is essential for execution of the Fortran code. It requires the path of the PDB file (for which the bonds have to be established) to be updated where specified. It can only process one PDB file at a time.
